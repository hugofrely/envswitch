# EnvSwitch - Project Status

**Current Version:** 0.1.0-alpha
**Status:** Early Development
**Last Updated:** 2024

## 🎯 Project Overview

EnvSwitch is a CLI tool that captures, saves, and restores the complete state of development environments. Think of it as "snapshots for your dev environment" - allowing developers to instantly switch between different client projects, work and personal environments, or testing scenarios.

## 📊 Development Progress

### ✅ Phase 0: Foundation (COMPLETED)

- [x] Project structure created
- [x] Go module initialized
- [x] CLI framework with Cobra
- [x] Basic command structure
- [x] Documentation foundation
- [x] Build system (Makefile)
- [x] CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions)
- [x] License and contributing guidelines

### 🚧 Phase 1: MVP (IN PROGRESS)

#### Core Infrastructure
- [x] Environment creation (`envswitch create`)
- [x] Environment listing (`envswitch list`)
- [x] Environment details (`envswitch show`)
- [x] Environment deletion (`envswitch delete`)
- [x] Basic metadata management
- [ ] Configuration system (partial)

#### Snapshot System
- [x] Tool interface defined
- [x] Storage utilities (copy, file operations)
- [ ] GCloud snapshot implementation
- [ ] Kubectl snapshot implementation
- [ ] AWS CLI snapshot implementation
- [ ] Docker snapshot implementation
- [ ] Git configuration snapshot implementation

#### Switching Logic
- [ ] Pre-switch backup creation
- [ ] Current state capture
- [ ] State restoration
- [ ] Rollback on failure
- [ ] History logging
- [ ] Current environment tracking (partial)

### 📅 Phase 2: Essential Features (PLANNED)

- [ ] Full tool integration (all 5+ tools)
- [ ] Environment variables handling
- [ ] History and rollback commands
- [ ] Shell integration (prompt)
- [ ] Auto-completion (bash/zsh/fish)
- [ ] Diff functionality
- [ ] Hooks system (pre/post switch)
- [ ] Verification system
- [ ] Comprehensive testing

### 🔮 Phase 3: Advanced Features (FUTURE)

- [ ] Encryption support
- [ ] TUI (Terminal UI)
- [ ] Template system
- [ ] Git sync
- [ ] Import/Export
- [ ] Plugin system
- [ ] Remote sync
- [ ] Team collaboration features

## 🎯 Next Immediate Tasks

### High Priority (Week 1-2)
1. **Implement file copying for snapshots**
   - Complete the `CopyDir` integration in tool implementations
   - Test snapshot creation for GCloud
   - Add error handling and validation

2. **Complete GCloud integration**
   - Implement full snapshot capture
   - Implement restore functionality
   - Add metadata extraction
   - Test with real GCloud configurations

3. **Implement switching logic**
   - Create backup system
   - Implement state save/restore flow
   - Add rollback on failure
   - Update current environment tracking

### Medium Priority (Week 3-4)
4. **Add Kubectl integration**
5. **Add AWS CLI integration**
6. **Add Docker integration**
7. **Add Git configuration integration**
8. **Implement environment variables handling**

### Lower Priority (Month 2)
9. **Shell integration**
10. **Auto-completion**
11. **History and rollback**
12. **Comprehensive testing**

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Current State
- ❌ No tests yet

### Needed
- [ ] Unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Integration tests for tool snapshots
- [ ] End-to-end tests for switching
- [ ] Test fixtures and mocks
- [ ] CI/CD test automation

## 📝 Known Limitations

1. **Snapshot system not functional** - Core feature still in development
2. **Switching logic incomplete** - Currently only updates marker, doesn't restore state
3. **No tool integrations complete** - All tool snapshots are TODO
4. **No encryption** - Sensitive data in snapshots not yet protected
5. **No verification** - No post-switch validation
6. **Limited error handling** - Needs improvement throughout
