# EnvSwitch - Project Status

**Status:** ✅ Production Ready (Stable)
**Last Updated:** October 7, 2025

## 🎯 Project Overview

EnvSwitch is a CLI tool that captures, saves, and restores the complete state of development environments. Think of it as "snapshots for your dev environment" - allowing developers to instantly switch between different client projects, work and personal environments, or testing scenarios.
